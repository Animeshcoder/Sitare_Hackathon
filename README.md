Hackathon Project: Face Recognition Attendance and Leave Management System

Problem Statement: The team identified the need for an efficient and reliable online platform to manage attendance and leaves in various organizations, especially in the current digital era. Traditional attendance systems may not adequately capture and verify the presence of individuals.

Solution: The team developed a Face Recognition Attendance and Leave Management System. This system uses face recognition technology to verify the identity of individuals and mark their attendance. It allows users to register, log in, and access various pages. It provides a robust system for managing attendance and leaves, which is crucial for the smooth operation of any organization. The backend was designed to be secure and efficient, capable of handling multiple requests simultaneously without compromising on performance.
